# RL-tic-tac-toe
An intro to Reinforcement Learning through Tic-Tac-Toe. Inspired by Sutton &amp; Barto, "Reinforcement Learning; An Introduction", 2nd ed.

Uses a definitive state-value table listing the expected values for all experienced states. On greedy actions, uses a model to test all available actions and chooses the one that gives the state with the highest value. This is a very early intro to RL since the state space and problem are so well-defined (and not very large).
